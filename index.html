          <p>Wheat is a common grain crop used to make all 
          kinds of foods, from pasta to bread to biscuits, with millions of tons grown every year 
          around the world. Australia is a largescale agricultural producer, 
          and one of its biggest products in the industry is wheat. <br></br>
          Introduced to Australia in 1788 with the arrival of the first fleet, it was initially 
          difficult to grow due to climate and soil differences. However, following artificial selection
          , it soon became a successful crop.
          Today, over 30,000 farmers grow it every year, and is worth 15% of Australia's agriculture 
          production- Australia's most valuable crop.</p>

          <p>Australia is the second-driest continent after Antarctica, and soils are 
            generally nutrient poor, making the majority of it's land unsuitable for 
            intensive agriculture and yields poorer than other countries around the world.
            <br></br>
            However, Australia's land has become more productive over time due to increased 
            fertiliser use and advances in equipment, reflected in the t/ha produced 
            in each state increasing over time. Tasmania's yield of 6.1 t/ha in 2019
            is the highest ever recorded in an Australian state.</p>

            <p> Wheat accounted for almost 75% of all crop production in the mid 1970s. The second biggest
              crop, barley, paled in comparison, worth less than 15% of the total market.
              <br></br>
              However producers have since begun diversifying their agriculture, with products such as chickpeas and
              canola entering the market, gradually reducing the wheat's proportion of Australia's total crop value.
              This can also be attributed to the recent production of canola due to it's high price 
              and global demand as a result of shortages in other countries. </p>

           <p> Wheat has always been Australia's highest value crop by a significant margin, and was 
            worth over 12.3 Billion AUD in 2020. The second most valuable crop produced was canola, 
            which was worth 6 Billion AUD. <br></br>
            The large downward spikes in the Industrial crop sector value are periods of drought, which affected 
            all crop production, including wheat. The millinium drought (2001-2009) was particularly severe and 
            features some of the largest decreases in value. </p>

            While land has used to grow wheat has varied over time, production has increased
            dramatically over time even holding land constant. More than 33,000kt was grown 
            from approximately 13,000 ha in 2020, compared to 20,000kt grown from the same
            area of land in 1983. </p>

          <p> Australia exports wheat to more than 25 countries around the world on three different continents. Most wheat is exported to 
            South East Asia,
            with a few African, Middle-Eastern and Pacific countries also receiving shipments each year. The number of countries exported to and total volume
            has increased dramatically over the last 30 years, with the amount of wheat exported in 1990 less than half of the amount exported in 2020.
            <br></br>
            Indonesia is Australia's biggest customer, likely due to it's relative proximity and 
            rapidly growing population.
            <br></br>
            No Australian wheat is exported to North or South America, likely because of the large distance and the fact
            that there are several large producers there, and so the high cost of shipping from Australia is not justified for 
            the buyers.</p>

            <p>In 2020, Australia was the 6th largest producer of wheat, 
              equivalent to 33Mt, one of just 14 countries that grew over 15Mt of wheat that year. 
              Conversely, the world's largest wheat producer, China, grew more than 134kt, more than 
              four times this amount. Despite China's high production, large volumes of Australian wheat are still 
              imported into China each year.</p>

            <p> Australian wheat production is predicted to decrease more than any other global region in 2021 and 
              2023, while reaching similar levels to 2020 in 2020. An explanation for this may be the recent price rises 
              of other agricultural products such as canola and falling wheat prices for wheat, reducing the 
              appeal of growing it in countries like Australia which have suitable conditions for growing many grain crops.</p>
