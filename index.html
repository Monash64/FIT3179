        <p>Australia is the second-driest continent after Antarctica, and soils are 
          generally nutrient poor, making the majority of it's land unsuitable for 
          intensive agriculture and yields poorer than other countries around the world.</p>
          
        <p>However, Australia's land has become more productive over time due to increased 
          fertiliser use and advances in equipment, reflected in the t/ha produced 
          in each state increasing over time. Tasmania's yield of 5.6 t/ha in 2020
          is the highest ever recorded in an Australian state.</p>

        <p> Wheat accounted for 75% of all crop production in the mid 1970s. The second biggest
          crop, barley, paled in comparison, worth less than 15% of the total market. </p>
          
          <p>However producers have since begun diversifying their agriculture, with products such as chickpeas and
          canola entering the market, gradually reducing the wheat's proportion of Australia's total crop value.
          This can also be attributed to the recent production of canola due to it's high price 
          and global demand as a result of shortages in other countries. </p>

      <div class="pure-u-1-2">

         <p> Wheat has always been Australia's highest value crop by a significant margin, and was 
          worth over 12.3 Billion AUD in 2020. The second most valuable crop produced was canola, 
          which was worth 6 Billion AUD. </p>

        <p> Australian wheat production is predicted to decrease more than any other global region in 2021 and 
          2023, while reaching similar levels to 2020 in 2020. An explanation for this may be the recent price rises 
          of other agricultural products such as canola and falling wheat prices for wheat, reducing the 
          appeal of growing it.</p>

        <p>In 2020, Australia was the 9th largest producer of wheat, growing more than 2% of wheat globally, 
          equivalent to 33kt. Conversely, the world's largest wheat producer, China, grew more than 134kt, more than 
          four times this amount. Despite China's high production, large volumes of Australian wheat are still 
          imported into China each year.</p>
